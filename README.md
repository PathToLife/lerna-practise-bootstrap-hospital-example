# lerna-practise-bootstrap-hospital-example

A monorepo for practising with learna and Typescript

Of special focus in this practise repo: Code editor intellisense support and can detect Typescript typings in the `integration` package.

# Future
Lerna seems to have changed owernship to `nx`, with some reports of it being deprecated.

For now this repo just serves as an first hand UX experience of the lerna monorepo system with typescript.

For servers and applications that require the full shebang (of note is QUIC support 2022), consider golang, C#, java.
