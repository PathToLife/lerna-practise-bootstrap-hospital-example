A monorepo for practising with learna and Typescript

Of special focus is making sure Code editor intellisense works and can detect Typescript typings in the integration package.

# Future
Lerna seems to have changed owernship to `nx`, with some reports of it being deprecated.
For now, just serve as an example of developer UX first hand experience of a lerna monorepo system.

For servers and applications that require the full shebang (of note is QUIC support 2022), consider golang, C#, java.
